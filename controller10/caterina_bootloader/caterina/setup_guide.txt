On the controller10 board, the ZERO_EN pin is connected to PD5.
This pin is flashed by the bootloader during upload and by the
arduino Serial functions whenever TX events are occuring.
To disable this, a modified Caterina bootloader needs to be used.

Modification:
TimeboxCaterina.c line 114 (right at the start of main()):
LED_SETUP();
TX_LED_ON();

caterina.h line 78 macro TX_LED_OFF() needs to be emptied
#define TX_LED_OFF()    //PORTD |= (1<<5)

The bootloader needs the exact Lufa version as specified,
a normal avr-gcc and can be used by 'make clean', 'make all' and 
'sh flashBootloader.sh'

Additionally Arduino_pins.h in 
/Users/.../Library/Arduino15/packages/arduino/hardware/avr/1.6.19/variants/leonardo

needs an edit in line 94-98:
#define TX_RX_LED_INIT  //DDRD |= (1<<5), DDRB |= (1<<0)
#define TXLED0          //PORTD |= (1<<5)
#define TXLED1          //PORTD &= ~(1<<5)
#define RXLED0          //PORTB |= (1<<0)
#define RXLED1          //PORTB &= ~(1<<0)
